# Skateboarding Clicky Game

Assignment Week 19, I created  a memory game with React. See App here: [Skateboarding Clicky Game](https://polar-dawn-72093.herokuapp.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deoployed on Heroku.



## Overview
This project required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. 

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
